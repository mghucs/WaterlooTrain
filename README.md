# WaterlooTrain
As part of a tax evasion scheme, a billionaire UW alumnus has agreed to make a charitable donation to fund a
local light-rail transit system between the various Waterloo campuses: University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier, and
Conestoga College. The route forms a loop, and there are two trains in service running continuously. One train runs
in a clockwise direction, the other runs in a counter-clockwise direction.
